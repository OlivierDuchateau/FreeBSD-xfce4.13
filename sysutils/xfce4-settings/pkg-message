Since XFCE 4.14 was updated to use gtk3 it is suggested to move to
a gtk3 compliant theme.

The Greybird theme and the xfce-elementary icons are now the defaults for xfce.

To switch to these new defaults you can:

Launch 'xfce4-appearance-settings', also available in the applications
menu, under settings/appearence, and go to 'Style' tab to select
the greybird theme and then to the 'Icons' tab to select the
xfce-elementary icons.

Then go to 'Window Manager' or launch 'xfwm4-settings' select greybird
theme.

Or launch these command in a shell:
  xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -t string -s "Greybird"
  xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/IconThemeName -t string -s "elementary-xfce"
  xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -t string -s "Greybird"
