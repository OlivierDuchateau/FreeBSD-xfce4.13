For LightDM to function, it requires one of the available greeters to be
installed, which are available in the ports tree at x11/lightdm-*greeter*

The installed default configuration has the option lock-memory set
to false. In this way LightDM will not use locked memory.

If this option is turned on (for example due to secority concerns)
LightDM needs the maximum amount of memory a daemon may request to
be locked into main memory using mlock(2) to be increased above the
FreeBSD default.

If you enable the lock-memory option, LightDM will often crash when
the service is started.

To increase this limit, run the following commands:
# sed -i '' -e 's/memorylocked=128M/memorylocked=256M/' /etc/login.conf
# cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf
EOD,
	type: install
}
